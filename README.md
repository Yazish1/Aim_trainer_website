# 🎯 Aim trainer (Website Edition)

I’ve ported my original **Pygame aim trainer** to the web using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By moving to a browser-based format, I’ve eliminated the need for local installations and dependencies. This version features a streamlined UI, smoother performance, and native fullscreen support for a more responsive experience.

## Features

- Multiple difficulty levels with scaled behavior
- Growing and shrinking targets
- Real-time score, HP and time tracking
- Accuracy calculation on game over
- Fullscreen option (press F)

## How to play

1. Select level: Choose difficulty to begin.
2. Hit targets: Click targets before they shrink and disappear
3. Manage health: Letting a target disappear depletes HP
4. Win condition: Reach a score of 30 (configurable in source code)
5. Controls: Press ESC to return to menu or exit.

## Tech

- HTML (Rendering)
- Vanilla JS - game logic and management
- CSS (Styling)
- No frameworks or libraries (yet)
